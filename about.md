# BlackoutClick

## What is BlackoutClick?

BlackoutClick is a Geometry Dash mod that adds an intense challenge layer to your gameplay experience. Every time you click or tap during a level, your screen will temporarily black out, forcing you to rely on memory, timing, and muscle memory to navigate through levels.

## Customization Options

The mod provides two main settings to tailor your experience:

1. **Blackout Duration**: Fine-tune how long the screen stays black (0-5 seconds)
2. **Blackout Color**: Choose any color for the overlay effect, including transparency (if you're a baby)
